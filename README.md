# smRNA-seq
Support the analysis of small RNA-seq, focusing on miRNA expression
This package will generate small RNA expression profiles based on aligned BAM file. Note that the alignment should be done to the genome DNA sequence, not miRNA database.

Step 1. Create a mapping file of all mature miRNAs on the genome;

Step 2. Count miRNAs and other RNA types based on the mapping file and various annotations;
